# banker-algorithm
banker algorithm
This is a C# implementation of the Banker's Algorithm, a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems.

The program takes as input the number of processes and resources, the total number of each resource available, the current allocation of resources to each process, and the maximum need of each process. It then calculates the available resources and checks if a given resource request from a process can be granted without causing a deadlock.
